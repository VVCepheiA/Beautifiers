MIPS Beautifiers
===========
A simple setup that makes assembly language MIPS(https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/mips/mipsref.pdf) more beautiful.

Notes Beautifiers
===========
A simple setup that makes your md Notes more beautiful. A notes site built with the Notes Beautifier: http://se2018.github.io/notes/ECE222/5_memory.html 

How to use:
++./concatenate.sh [yourmarkdownfilename.md]

It will generates a filename.html for you and if you put the notes.css in the same folder, it will look beautiful, I promise =W=
